# Problem statement for the project
Using the data on grocery purchases in [groceries.txt], some interesting association rules for these shopping baskets have been found out.  
Thresholds for lift and confidence have been picked and discoveries are presented in a concise and graphical way.  

Notes: 
This is an exercise in visual and numerical story-telling.  
The focus is kept on the data, the figures, and the insights drawn from the data.
